This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I built as a mini project. It’s perfect for playing with a friend and a fun way to learn some coding basics.

# What’s Inside?
 -Two players can play
 -3x3 grid board
 -Shows who wins, or if it’s a tie
 -Simple and easy to use
 -Runs in the terminal or has a simple UI (depending on how you built it)

# How to Play
  -Players take turns putting X or O on the board
  -The first to get 3 in a row (up/down/side/diagonal) wins
  -If all spots fill up and nobody wins, it’s a tie!
